This project was for a website for my Information and Database Management class that was worked on by me and 2 other people. The website is one that manages 
train schedules and routes and makes use of a database using SQL to allow the client to update information to it. This includes customers making reservations, 
deleting them, letting admins add new routes, exmployees and customers making accounts with credentials, etc. The mainpage displays all the upcoming train routes,
showing their arrival times to each station along the way. This project used AWS and tomcat to work, and included here are the JSP files that were used to make
the website. They make the use of SQL, HTML, JavaScript and some CSS.
